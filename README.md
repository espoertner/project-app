# My Project Plan Name

## Project Summary
What the project is about and will allow the user to do

## Technical summary
Description of the languages, frameworks, libraries, APIs, list of database tables, or other tools that you will use on the project

## Features
A list, preferably with bullet points or in a spreadsheet, of the features of your application. This list will be different for every project, but may include a list of web pages, interactive and/or non-interactive user features, the data being collected or processed, what the results will look like, viewable screens, and any other relevant description of user features for your application. In short, your mentors or a potential employer should know exactly what to expect from your project by reading this list without having seen it running.

## Milestones
List of each major step of the project that will result in completing the above feature list. This generally should be the order in which you will build the features/pages/etc. Milestones may include things like when you will build a certain page/screen, add in API endpoints, create your database, implement a certain framework/library, and other such details.

## Requirements to run the project
If your project requires anything special to run it, you must document this so mentors and potential employers can run your project. Examples of things to document include: having to install and run a jupyter notebook, running npm install in a certain directory, or running your project from Visual Studio.
